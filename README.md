# ðŸ“œ Script Description: Combat Roll Prevention (Optimized)

This lightweight and optimized FiveM client-side script disables the player's ability to perform combat rolls while aiming with any weapon. It achieves this by blocking the jump control (Control 22) only during active free aiming, preventing the common roll-exploit used in combat scenarios.

Disables combat rolling while aiming (no interference when not aiming)

Efficient use of IsPedArmed with weapon type 6 (covers all weapons)

Checks player state only when necessary for minimal performance impact

Uses DisableControlAction responsively for fluid gameplay

# ðŸŽ¯ Use Cases:

Prevents players from abusing combat roll mechanics in gunfights

Encourages more realistic and tactical combat behavior

Ideal for serious RP and competitive server environments
